    <div id="tribute-info"><p><ol><li>Abdul Sattar Edhi NI LPP GPA (Urdu: عبد الستار ایدھی; 28 February 1928[6] – 8 July 2016) was a Pakistani
    humanitarian, philanthropist and ascetic who founded the Edhi Foundation, which runs the world's largest volunteer
    ambulance network,[9] along with various homeless shelters, animal shelters,[10] rehabilitation centres, and orphanages
    across Pakistan.[11] Following his death, his son Faisal Edhi took over as head of the Edhi Foundation.</li>
    <br/>
    
    <li><p>Edhi's charitable activities expanded greatly in 1957 when an Asian flu epidemic (originating in China) swept
    through
    Pakistan and the rest of the world. Donations allowed him to buy his first ambulance the same year. He later
    expanded
    his charity network with the help of his wife Bilquis Edhi.</p></li>

        Over his lifetime, the Edhi Foundation expanded, backed entirely by private donations, which included establishing a
        network of 1,800 ambulances. By the time of his death, Edhi was registered as a parent or guardian of nearly 20,000
        adopted children.[7] He is known amongst Pakistanis as the "Angel of Mercy" and is considered to be Pakistan's most
        respected and legendary figure.[3][13] In 2013, The Huffington Post claimed that he might be "the world's greatest
        living humanitarian".</p></li>
        <li>
            
            <p> Edhi maintained a hands-off management style and was often critical of the corruption commonly found within the
        religious organizations, clergy and politicians.[15] He was a strong proponent of religious tolerance in Pakistan and
        extended his support to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and the 1985 famine in Ethiopia.[16][17] He was nominated
        several times for the Nobel Peace Prize. Edhi received several awards including the Gandhi Peace Award, Ahmadiyya Muslim
        Peace Prize and the UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize.[18] He died in July 2016 and was buried with full state honours.</p></li>
